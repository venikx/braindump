        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

            name: 'Kevin R'
            age: 25
        };
        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = me;
        captain.number = 99;
        console.log(captain, me); // same object, since it's a reference
        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {
            number: 99
        });
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        //const cap2 = { ...me
        //};
        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
