Permanent notes are atomic notes (single idea), which can and should be used to
in different molecules (contexts). They start from [[file:20210222004051-fleeting-notes.org][Fleeting Notes]], [[file:20210222005758-literature-notes.org][Literature
Notes]] or pre-existing knowledge.

Ask yourself a couple questions before creating permanent notes:
- How does the new information reflect itself on the existing information?
- What kind of potential new molecule can I create from an existing atom using
  the new information?
- How do I want to stumble across this note in the future?

The notes should be written as if they are written for someone else, because
future self is bound to be someone else.
