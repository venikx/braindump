#+TITLE: Databases

Relational database are faster, when you are running queries on your data. If you want to do that
with a non-relational database you'd need to get the data, parse it, then send it. Really think
about what kind of data you are storing, before chosing a database.

- relational :: data that related to something else, which needs ~SQL~
- non-relational :: document(key)-value store, which doesn't need ~SQL~

Data-in, data-out probably favors a non-relational database. Writing and reading is super fast,
since you can just dump the whole dataset in there.

* Best-practices
- Back up database
- Use a strong root password
- Don't expose the database outside the network
- Sanitize your SQ
