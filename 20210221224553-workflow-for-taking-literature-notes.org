* Sifting through the random crap first
1. Gather + tag in raindrop.io (bookmarks on steroids)
2. Skim through the potential resource
   a. Throw away when it's useless
   b. Move to /TODO/ folder if it stays relevant
3. Move to /IN PROGRESS/ and create an empty literature note
* Physical Books
1. Look up ISBN and to generate [[https://zbib.org/][bibliography information]]
2. Read and take notes inside the book (if you own it)
3. Is the book complex/long (a) or not (b)
   a. Transcribe into org-roam per chapter
   b. Transcribe into org-roam after completely finishing the book
* Digital Books
1. Look up ISBN and to generate [[https://zbib.org/][bibliography information]]
2. Read the book and take notes in org-roam immediately
3. Is the book complex/long (a) or not (b)
   a. Try digesting the literature per chapter to form ideas
   b. Digest the whole literature notes at once
* Videos
1. Set the speed to 2x if possible and pause the video when taking notes
2. If unfinished mark the current timestamp to continue later on
* Articles
1. Read the article and take notes in org-roam immediately
2. Resist the urge to copy-pasta because articles are an easy trap
