* Layout
** Grids
Grid helps to break down layout into smaller components, so we don't have to think
about color, layout, typography,... at the same time.

** Balance
*Symmentry* is used to keep layouts nice and clean. However without *asymmetry* it makes
the design look flat, boring and basic. The beauty of design is about balancing out
asymmetry vs symmetry.
