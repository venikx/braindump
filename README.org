* What is this madness?
  A massive personal, educational notes dump when studying several topics,
using different media forms: books, blog posts, videos, code snippets, ...

* Reminders while studying
** Avoid thinking too much about results, focus on the process
   - Use 25/5 Pomodoro Technique
   - Capture tasks with org-capture

** Procrastination, what is it?
  - Cue (habit)
  - Routine (zombie mode)
  - Reward
  - Belief

** Stay healthy
   Eat enough healthy fats (omega-3), use flash cards and try to memorize
small tasks in a memory palace.
