* Event Delegation
avoids adding event listeners to specific nodes. A parent node can listen for events
happening in it's children, by hooking up an event listener on the node. The parent can
delegate the event back to the correct child.

* Event Propagation
is the fact that an event (for example: ~click~) on an element. The browser first ripples
the event down, until it found the source. The browser bubbles up the event when the
location was found.
